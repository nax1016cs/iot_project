Combine the MAX7219 matrix display with IOTtalk in NCTU.
In this project, my teamates and I combine the IOTtalk server with ESP8266 chip and MAX7219 display. As the user press the button on IOTtalk, the figure on MAX7219 will show different shapes. 

Moreover, the user can even play little games with them! In the game mode, there will be serveral obstacle scrolling throw the screen. All the user need to do is press the button to prevent the person from touching the obstacle. Absolutely, there is also score board on it.
